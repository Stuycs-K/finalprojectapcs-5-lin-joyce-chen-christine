## Joyce Lin

### 2025-05-22 - Started preliminary coding and creating skeletons - 3.5 hours
Started the coding on main game tab (catformers), Character Class and Projectile Class. Currently, horizontal movement works but is a little wonky, jumping works (will have to consider base jump power and other things), and projectiles can be created (destroyed after three bounces). Some code (like for aiming) remains untested. Created a Platform tab but did no work on it.
