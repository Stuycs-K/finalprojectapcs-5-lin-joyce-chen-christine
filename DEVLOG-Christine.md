Worked slightly more than 2 hours. Completed platforms class and added collision mechanics for players and projectile bouncing. Fixed + completed aiming logic and displayed aiming direction (need to work on controls/convenience of changing directions and with 2 players). Added reload cooldown for shooting and 2-player controls.
