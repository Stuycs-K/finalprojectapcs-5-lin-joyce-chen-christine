# IDEAS:

1 Platformer + tanks + cuphead blend
https://www.twoplayergames.org/game/tanks
https://www.cupheadgame.com

Desc: 2D platformer shooter where 1-2 players control animal characters that shoot bouncing projectiles at one another. Players must navigate platformers, aim, and shoot in either Versus mode (2 players) or a bonus if finished Boss mode (1-2 players).

2 Block Blast
https://block-blast.io/

Desc: Game where players place blocks on a 10x10 board. If a roll or column is full, it will be cleared. When no valid moves remain, the game is lost.

3 Arcade stacking game
https://filiprei.itch.io/stacker-arcade-game

Desc: Timing game where the player presses space to stack a moving block directly on top of the previous one. Block shrinks if not perfectly aligned; game over if no block is stacked.
