Catformers
2D platformer shooter where 1-2 players control cat characters that shoot bouncing projectiles at one another. Players must navigate platforms, aim, and shoot in either Versus mode (2 players) or Boss mode (1 player). In Versus mode: Players share one keyboard and , In Boss mode:

## Critical Features
Versus mode (two characters shoot bullets at each other and can jump from platform to platform)
- you win by hitting the other person 2-3
- bullets bounce (orbs) and goes away after 3-4 bounces

Boss mode (1-2 characters fight a stationary boss (hp and damage scales on how many players) with multiple phases after reaching a certain health level while navigating platforms)
- you win by killing the boss and lose by everyone dying (character dies after being hit 1-2 times)

character selection (at least 3 total characters)

characters hold down jump to jump higher

start/end screen

## Nice to Have Features
bgm + sound effects (cats possibly voiced by mr Ks cats with permission !!)

different backgrounds + maps (map selection screen or random map)

little storyline for boss mode -- fight smaller monsters before reaching Boss
- when you reach the end of the screen, you tp back to the left and map refreshes until you reach the boss (1-3 map changes?)

revive feature in boss mode when your character dies and your teammate is alive


# Project Design

UML Diagrams and descriptions of key algorithms, classes, and how things fit together.

|  Key Stuff           |  description  |
| :-------------: | :-------: |
|  projectile class     |        |
|  character class     |          |
|  platform class     |         |
|  jump power class     |        



# Intended pacing:

How you are breaking down the project and who is responsible for which parts.

A timeline with expected completion dates of parts of the project. (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)
projectile class (include reload variable, bounce variable, and type variable ) + character class
platform class
