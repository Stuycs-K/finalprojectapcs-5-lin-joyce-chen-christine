# Project Description

*Catformers* is a 2D platformer-shooter game where 1-2 players control cat characters (Catformers) who leap across platforms and fire bouncing projectiles. Players can select from several unique Catformers with diverse abilities and engage in fast-paced, action-packed combat across multiple game modes.

# Intended usage:

After launching and entering *Catformers*, players are prompted to choose between two game modes: **Versus Mode** and **Boss Mode**.

- In **Versus Mode**, two players compete to deplete each other's lives through strategic movements and precise shots——the last Catformer standing wins.
- In **Boss Mode**, players team up or play solo to defeat a powerful, multi-phase boss. Victory is achieved by reducing the boss's health to zero before all players are eliminated.

Once a mode is selected, players are taken to the **chaarcter selection screen**, where each player chooses their Catformer using the displayed keyboard controls.
