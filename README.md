# Project Description

*Catformers* is a 2D platformer-shooter game where 1-2 players control cat characters (Catformers) who leap across platforms and fire bouncing projectiles. The game features two main modes: Versus Mode (PvP) and Boss Mode (Single-Player or Co-Op).
In Versus Mode, players complete to deplete each other's lives through strategic movements and precise shots——the last Catformer standing wins! In Boss Mode, players must cooperate (or go solo) to defeat a powerful, multi-phase boss. Victory is achieved by reducing the boss's health to zero before all players are eliminated.
In either game mode, players can select from several unique Catformers with diverse abilities and engage in fast-paced, action-packed combat.
